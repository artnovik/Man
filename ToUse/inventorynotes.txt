In Trello tasks you mentioned:
1. Chest with items (So, not the weapons only, the game should contain other items, please describe them) which can be dropped and collected by player

**Yeah there will be many other items, but I don't know what they are yet :) good example is health potion (which I think there is asset for)
Stuff like ammo, contaminated blood, brain slime


Asumming this: you want stats system for weapons, right?

**Yeah stats for weapons should be like speed, damage, range etc 
Like scythe:
Speed: Slow
Range: Mid
Damage: High
(type Arcane/water/fire etc)


Ritual Blade:
Speed: Fast
Range: small
Damage: mid
(type Arcane/water/fire etc)

And you also want inventory for player (or player just collects and switches weapons?)
**Yeah we need inventory system, don't worry about the UI for now

Also, should characters (enemies, player) also have their stats (you mentioned "armor" for Chester), 
or they should just have different hp values (for example, we can reduce it maxValue for Chester)? 

***Everyone will have stats from a base class and the class should be extended to each character:
Health
Stamina
Speed
Strength/Damage (this kind of depends on the weapon)
Arcane (if they have arcane they can do magic, but are also more resistant to magic)
Fire Resistance (water characters are weak to fire damage/strong to water damage)
Water Resistance (fire characters are weak to water damage/strong to fire damage)

Also, should their attack completely depend on weapon they're using or, again, there's some sort of stats for characters?
**Yeah mostly but affected by their strength and weapon weight

Also, if we're switching on Vanessa, should she have her own stats(if I'll create this system), hp, weapons, and inventory(if I'll create this system), or all playable characters sharing this stuff among them?

**Yeah they have their own stats, weapons and inventory
